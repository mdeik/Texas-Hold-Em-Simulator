# Texas-Hold-Em-Simulator
This is a Texas Hold'Em Simulator written in Java. As one might assume, this allows the user to simulate a game of Texas Hold'Em. The game is played by 6 computer players while the user functions as the dealer. The user can shuffle, cut, deal, and flop the deck however they wish. The simulator will then evaluate the "players'" hand each turn. This Java application was created for a computer science course aimed at developing Java programming skills.
Java class file called "Deck" represents a standard deck of cards used for playing Texas Hold 'Em. The "Deck" class is a fundamental component of a larger program used to simulate Texas Hold 'Em. The code consists of two constructors that initialize the deck with 52 card objects, methods that retrieve information about the deck such as the card at a specific position and the number of cards left in the deck, and methods that shuffle and cut the deck. 
This project demonstrates the ability to create and manipulate arrays of objects, use object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation and inheritance, and apply programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and exceptions. Furthermore, reveals a strong understanding of how a deck of cards is used in the context of Texas Hold 'Em, as evidenced by the methods that shuffle and cut the deck. Overall, this reveals Java programming abilities as well as an understanding of the Texas Hold 'Em game.

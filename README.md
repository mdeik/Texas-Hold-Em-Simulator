# Texas-Hold-Em-Simulator
This is a Java application called "Texas Hold 'Em Simulator" that I developed for a programming course. The application simulates a game of Texas Hold 'Em, allowing users to play against computer-generated opponents. The app includes features such as shuffling and cutting the deck as well as hand evaluation.
